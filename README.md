# Email Spam Model

## Overview
The **Email Spam Model** project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify emails as spam or not spam (ham). The project uses various text processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
- Preprocessing of email text data
- Use of TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Implementation of Logistic Regression for classification
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance

## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MassimilianoVisintainer/Email-Spam-Model.git
cd Email-Spam-Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the dataset**: Ensure you have your email dataset ready in the appropriate format.
2. **Run the model**: Execute the following command to train the model:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Make predictions**: To classify new emails, use:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input <path_to_email_file>
   ```

## Data
The dataset used in this project is composed of labeled emails, containing both spam and ham messages. Ensure to place your dataset in the designated folder as specified in the code.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Results will be displayed in the console after training.
